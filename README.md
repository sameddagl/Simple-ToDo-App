# Simple-ToDo-App
I created a basic todo app with swift using UIKit Framework. Y
ou can add task by using plus button on the top right corner and delete a task simply by swiping to the right. If you want to delete all tasks on your todo list, you can click on the trash button on the top right corner.
I used navigation controller for navigation and table view controller for the tasks. To store data I used UserDefaults (I know it is not the best way to store data but I am on the beginning of my IOS development journey.)
